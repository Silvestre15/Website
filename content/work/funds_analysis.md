In the following paragraphs, we will take a dive into the latest publicly available information regarding the positions of some of the most followed fund managers. Said information comes from the 13F filings that Institutional Investment Managers have to report on a quarterly basis. It is important to note that said information can be disclosed up to 45 days after the end of said quarter.

In the case of this analysis, the reports reflect the holdings of the funds on the 31st of March of 2022. Holdings between that date and the date the report is published can vary, meaning the reports don't have to reflect the funds' actual holdings. 

Nonetheless, said reports give a great amount of information regarding the strategy and thoughts of the fund managers.
