        <article role="article" class="flex-container"><p>Thomas Piketty&rsquo;s first part of <a href="/reads" title="Check out what I&#39;m currently reading">Capital et Idéologie</a> talks about the unequal distribution of wealth between individuals. Below are some of the graphs that caught my eye because of how much they speak for themselves.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">
  function iframeLoaded() {
      var iFrameID = document.getElementById('custom_resize');
      if(iFrameID) {
            iFrameID.height = "";
            iFrameID.height = iFrameID.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + "px";
            window.frames[0].document.body.style.backgroundColor=window.getComputedStyle( document.body ,null).getPropertyValue('background-color')
      }   
  }
</script>
<p>
<iframe src="/elephant.html" scrolling=no id="custom_resize" onload="iframeLoaded()" allowTransparency="true" class="iframe-left"></iframe>
The above graph, dubbed the elephant's curve because of its looks, represents the growth in wealth experienced by the different income groups since 1980. Piketty points to three important parts of the elephant. The hips show the growth of the lower class, the group comprised between the 10th and 50th top percentile. The back, standing at a lower point than the hips, shows the "forgotten middle class" according to the author because of the great difference in growth rates experienced by the latter. The trunk is quite interesting, as it shows how the wealthy have seen their riches grow in comparison with the rest of the people. This last part of the curve is almost exponential-like for the richest have seen their wealth grow at the highest rates compared with the rest of the population.
</p>
<p>This graph allows one to see how the share of the top decile (that is, the top 10%) in the total wealth grew over the same period as analyzed in the elephant&rsquo;s curve. More detailed, the graph displays information about different countries as well as Europe, and sharp contrasts arise when overlaying the paths. Russia (green) has seen the sharpest rise of all when the Berlin wall fell in 1989. Europe on the other hand has remained stable both politically and in the discussed matter in comparison to the rest of the analyzed states. India has formidably outpaced its peers, resulting in that the top decile owns more than half of the country&rsquo;s wealth since 2009.</p>
</p>
<p>In order to dive deeper into the analysis of the figure &ldquo;Divergence&rdquo;, turning the data into a base one hundred index seemed appropriate to better visualize the growth experienced by the 10% wealthiest in each region. As mentioned earlier, Russia&rsquo;s wealthiest have seen their riches grow at rates unlike no other country in this analysis right after the disintegration of the communist bloc. In 30 years, the top decile&rsquo;s share in total wealth doubled when the index value reached 200 in 2008.</p>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The main issue is not only that the richest have gotten richer as time passed by, but also that the poorest have gotten poorer during that same period. The app below allows one to compare how the richest 10% have performed in comparison with the poorer 50%.
<iframe src="https://silvestred.shinyapps.io/inequality/" scrolling=no allowTransparency="true" class="iframe-inequality-app" style="width:100%"></iframe></p>
<p>Piketty points out to the fact that there is a considerable difference between wealth and income with the following phrase:</p>
<div class="quote">
Il est possible de vivre sans posséder, mais non sans se nourrir.
</div>
<p>One may live without owning anything, but not without eating. With that the author draws the attention to the fact that a balanced distribution of the generated income is more crucial than that of wealth. In the app above we can compare the differences in magnitude between the two.</p>
