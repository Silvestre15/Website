      <description>Thomas Piketty&amp;rsquo;s first part of Capital et Idéologie talks about the unequal distribution of wealth between individuals. Two graphs caught my attention.
&amp;nbsp;
   &amp;nbsp;
The above graph, dubbed the elephant&amp;rsquo;s curve because of its looks, represents the growth in wealth experienced by the different income groups since 1980. Piketty points to three important parts of the elephant. The hips show the growth of the lower class, the group comprised between the 10th and 50th top percentile.</description>

      <title>Visualizing the stock market structure</title>

      <description>This project analyses the structure of the main Spanish stock market index by means of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques included inside scikit-learn&amp;rsquo;s Python package. The original code was written by Gaël Varoquaux, one of the creators of the widely used package.
  The thicker the line between two companies and the brighter its colour, the greater the covariance between the daily fluctuations of said companies. The algorithm also clusters the companies based on the similarity of their impact on the index.</description>

      <description>This project, which is part of my curricular work, looks at the potential implementation of sandboxes in the Spanish administration in order to increase its efficiency. More precisely, its aim is to asses the potential benefits that may accompany the use of such systems when it comes to develop or buy new technologies to implement inside the state administration.
For this, extensive researches have been made inside the state&amp;rsquo;s official websites, information regarding annual budgets to Research and Development (R&amp;amp;D) expenses at the national level has been retrieved in order to corroborate the whole paper.</description>

      <description>Chapter One&amp;nbsp;¶ It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</description>

      <description>Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing. Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</description>

      <description>Now pleasing sleep had seal&amp;rsquo;d each mortal eye,
Stretch&amp;rsquo;d in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:
The immortals slumber&amp;rsquo;d on their thrones above;
All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.(76)
To honour Thetis&#39; son he bends his care,
And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:
Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,
And thus commands the vision of the night.
&amp;ldquo;Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,(77)</description>
